# Reflection
## Approach
> What was your approach to the dataset? What problem did you want to solve? What technology did you decide to use? How did your team split the work?
> We did data analysis, data visualization and text mining on the datasets.
> We would like to see if there was any relationship between student's activities on canvas and their academic performance, what kind of modules or activities they were most intereted in, and 
 
## Wins / Challenges
> Describe some wins / challenges. What did you learn? What would you do differently next time?
> Wins: What we have found is more or less what we expected.
> Challenges: The data is samll and not perfect, so it is challenging to clean the data, find connections between datasets, and find insights at the beginning.
