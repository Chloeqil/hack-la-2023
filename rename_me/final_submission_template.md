# This Project<br>

> Give a brief description of the final product:
>  There are some findings we have obtained.
>  1. On average, if students spend more time on Canvas, they are likelier to get a higher score. But it is not a guaranty for a ggod grade, inefficiency is also an essential element.
>  2. Users are most active in the latter part of the day, from Sundays to Thursdays, but on Fridays, te activity is the lowest in a week. The suggestion for the professor would be to release materials on days that students are active.

# Reflection
## Approach<br>
> What was your approach to the dataset? What problem did you want to solve? What technology did you decide to use? How did your team split the work?
> We did data analysis, data visualization and text mining on the datasets.
> We would like to see if there was any relationship between student's activities on canvas and their academic performance, how to iimprove one's study performance, what kind of modules or activities they were most intereted in. 
 
## Wins / Challenges<br>
> Describe some wins / challenges. What did you learn? What would you do differently next time?
> Wins: What we have found is more or less what we expected.
> Challenges: The datasets are small and not perfect, so it is challenging to clean the data, find connections between datasets, and find insights at the beginning.
